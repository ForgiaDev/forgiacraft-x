## Tips & Tricks

### For New Players

1. **Learn REI first** - Press `R` on any item to learn its recipe. This is your best friend in modded Minecraft!

2. **Set waypoints early** - Use `Shift+B` to mark your base, villages, and important locations

3. **Voice chat is proximity-based** - The closer you are to someone, the louder they sound

4. **Save your hotbar** - Press `C` to save your current hotbar setup before switching tools

### For Create Users

- **Hold W while holding a Create item** to see animated guides (Ponder)
- **Left Alt** gives quick access to wrenches and Create tools
- Use **goggles** (from Create) to see stress/speed info on contraptions

### Performance Tips

- **Toggle shaders** with `Ctrl+K` if you need better FPS
- **Hide the minimap** with `M` during intense moments
- Close the **REI panel** with `Ctrl+O` for a cleaner screen

## Conflicts Resolved

Some keys appear multiple times but won't conflict because they're **context-dependent**:

- **C**: Save Toolbar (general) vs. Pitch Mode (only when using cannons) vs. Chat Position (only in fullscreen map)
- **H**: Hide Voice Icons (general) vs. Disable Buttons (only in fullscreen map)
- **Left Alt**: All Create mod features work together
- **O**: Fullscreen Map Options (only in map) vs. Shader Selection (Ctrl+O)

These won't interfere during normal gameplay!

---

## File Locations

If you need to manually edit keybinds:

- **Main keybinds:** `options.txt`
- **AMECS modifiers:** `options.amecsapi.txt`
- **REI keybinds:** `config/roughlyenoughitems/config.json5`

> **Note:** It's easier to change keybinds in-game via Options → Controls!
